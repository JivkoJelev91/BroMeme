## 🎧 Vibe Coding

This project was built in a flow state with the help of multiple AI tools — what we like to call **Vibe Coding**. No overthinking, no endless docs — just creative momentum assisted by intelligent code and design agents.

- 🤖 **Code** co-written with Claude 3.7 and GitHub Copilot in real time
- ⚡️ AI agents decided file structure, naming, and even animations
- 🎯 Focused purely on **user experience**, speed, and joy of creation
